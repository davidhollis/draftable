# Draftable

_A virtual draft table_

Draftable is a web application for conducting virtual Magic: the Gathering drafts with friends. It's scriptable, allowing for custom draft rules or card sets, and supports exporting to Magic Online or Magic Arena for gameplay.

It's very incomplete (read: nonfunctional) right now, but this space will eventually contain setup instructions for a private Draftable server.
